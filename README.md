## EfexiaEQ

### What is it?
Efexia software for keeping track of multiple (MT5) terminals accounts and their sum total Equity.

### How does it work?
Installing the (MetaTrader 5 only) application onto any number of Terminals running on the same system allows the app to communicate the current Equity levels of each account. 
User can select up to 4 accounts to show their live fed Equity in the same Terminal, eliminating the need for constantly switching between Terminals. 
User can also, in the same window, select which of the accounts Equity should be summed to a Total Equity. This makes risk management a lot easier, when handling 
several accounts at the same time whos total Equity is subject to maximum drawdown limits. It is also possible to set account-specific Equity-based alarm levels 
as well as sum total Equity alarm levels. For convenience, a close-everything button is also made available.
